# Traffic_Bridge

Traffic Synchronization: this small project implements threads, semaphores and deadlocks that we learned in the Operating Systems course.

It synchronizes traffic over a narrow light-duty bridge in the region. Traffic may only cross the bridge in one direction at a time, and if there are ever more than 3 vehicles on the bridge at 
one time, it will collapse under their weight.
